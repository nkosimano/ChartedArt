# üì± ChartedArt Mobile App - Complete Testing Guide

## üéØ **QUICK ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION**

### **"No usable data found" when scanning QR code?**

**‚ùå You're using the wrong app!**

You **CANNOT** use your phone's built-in camera app to scan the Expo QR code. You **MUST** use the **Expo Go app**.

---

## ‚úÖ **CORRECT WAY TO TEST THE MOBILE APP**

### **Step 1: Download Expo Go App**

1. **iOS (iPhone/iPad):**
   - Open App Store
   - Search for "Expo Go"
   - Download and install
   - **Link:** https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779

2. **Android:**
   - Open Google Play Store
   - Search for "Expo Go"
   - Download and install
   - **Link:** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent

---

### **Step 2: Start the Mobile App Server**

```bash
# Navigate to mobile directory
cd mobile

# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

**What you'll see:**
- A QR code in your terminal
- A URL like `exp://192.168.1.xxx:8081`
- Metro bundler running

---

### **Step 3: Connect Your Phone**

#### **Option A: Scan QR Code (Recommended)**

1. **Open Expo Go app** on your phone (NOT your camera app!)
2. **iOS:** Tap "Scan QR Code" on the home screen
3. **Android:** Tap "Scan QR Code" on the Projects tab
4. **Scan the QR code** from your terminal
5. Wait for the app to load

#### **Option B: Manual URL Entry**

1. Open Expo Go app
2. Tap "Enter URL manually"
3. Copy the URL from your terminal (looks like `exp://192.168.1.xxx:8081`)
4. Paste and press "Connect"

#### **Option C: Tunnel Mode (If network issues)**

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
npx expo start --tunnel
```

This creates a public URL that works from anywhere. Scan the new QR code with Expo Go.
