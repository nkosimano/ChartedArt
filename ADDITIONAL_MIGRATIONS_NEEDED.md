# Additional Migrations Required

## Missing Movements System

You're getting errors about the `movements` table because the movements system migration hasn't been run yet.

### Error Message
```
Could not find the table 'public.movements' in the schema cache
```

### Solution

You need to run the movements system migration in your Supabase SQL Editor:

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251016_001_movements_system.sql`

This migration creates:
- `movements` table - Core table for social impact campaigns
- `movement_metrics` table - Real-time metrics
- `movement_participants` table - User participation tracking
- `movement_donations` table - Donation tracking
- `movement_products` table - Products linked to movements
- `movement_events` table - Events linked to movements
- `movement_updates` table - News/blog for movements
- All necessary triggers, functions, and RLS policies

### How to Apply

1. Open your Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/20251016_001_movements_system.sql`
3. Paste and execute in the SQL Editor
4. Verify the tables were created by checking the Table Editor

### Note

The movements system is an optional feature. If you don't need social impact campaigns/fundraising functionality, you can:
- Either run the migration to avoid errors
- Or remove/comment out the MovementManagement component from your application

The movements system won't interfere with your product management features - it's a separate module.
