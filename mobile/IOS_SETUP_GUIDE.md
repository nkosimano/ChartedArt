# üì± iOS Setup Guide - Run on Your iPhone

## Good News: iOS is MUCH Easier! üéâ

Unlike Android, you **don't need Xcode, SDKs, or environment variables** to test on your iPhone with Expo Go.

## üöÄ Quick Start (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install Expo Go on Your iPhone

1. Open **App Store** on your iPhone
2. Search for **"Expo Go"**
3. Download and install the app (it's free)
4. Open Expo Go once to set it up

- Check your computer's WiFi
- Check your iPhone's WiFi (Settings ‚Üí WiFi)
- Make sure they're the exact same network name

### Step 3: Start Expo Server

On your computer:

```bash
cd C:\Users\dhliso\Development\ChartedArt\mobile
npx expo start
```

### Step 4: Scan QR Code

**On your iPhone:**

1. Open the **Expo Go** app
2. Tap **"Scan QR Code"** on the home screen
3. Point your camera at the QR code in your terminal
4. Wait 5-10 seconds for the app to load

**That's it! Your app is now running on your iPhone!** üéä

## üìã iOS Testing Checklist

- [ ] Expo Go app installed on iPhone
- [ ] iPhone and computer on same WiFi
- [ ] Expo server running (`npx expo start`)
- [ ] QR code scanned with Expo Go
- [ ] App loaded successfully

---

## üîß Alternative Connection Methods

### Method 1: Manual URL Entry

If QR code doesn't work:

1. In your terminal, find the line: `‚Ä∫ Metro waiting on exp://192.168.x.x:8081`
2. In Expo Go app, tap **"Enter URL manually"**
3. Type the URL exactly as shown
4. Tap "Connect"

### Method 2: Tunnel Mode (Works Anywhere)

If you're on different networks or behind a firewall:

```bash
npx expo start --tunnel
```

This creates a public URL that works from anywhere. Scan the new QR code.

## üçé When Do You Need Xcode?

You **only** need Xcode if you want to:

### ‚ùå You DON'T need Xcode for:
- Testing with Expo Go ‚úÖ
- Development and debugging ‚úÖ
- Most Expo features ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ You DO need Xcode for:
- Running iOS Simulator on Mac (not available on Windows)
- Building standalone iOS apps (.ipa files)
- Using custom native modules not supported by Expo Go
- Publishing to App Store

**Since you're on Windows, you can't use iOS Simulator anyway.**

## üì± iOS vs Android Development

| Feature | iOS (iPhone) | Android (Emulator) |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Setup Time** | 2 minutes | 45-75 minutes |
| **Requirements** | Expo Go app | Android Studio + SDK |
| **Connection** | Scan QR code | Scan QR code or press 'a' |
| **Performance** | Real device (fast) | Emulator (slower) |
| **Environment Variables** | None needed | ANDROID_HOME required |
| **Simulator on Windows** | ‚ùå Not possible | ‚úÖ Yes (emulator) |

**Winner: iOS is WAY easier for development!** üèÜ

---

## üéØ Recommended Workflow

### For Daily Development:
1. **Use your iPhone with Expo Go** (fastest, easiest)
2. Test on real device = better performance
3. No setup, no configuration needed

### For Android Testing:
1. **Use Android emulator** (when you need to test Android-specific features)
2. Slower but necessary for Android compatibility

### Best of Both Worlds:
- Develop primarily on iPhone (fast, easy)
- Test on Android emulator occasionally
- This gives you cross-platform coverage

## üö® Common iOS Issues

### "Could not connect to development server"

**Solution 1: Check WiFi**
- iPhone and computer on same network?
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting WiFi on both

**Solution 2: Use Tunnel Mode**
```bash
npx expo start --tunnel
```

**Solution 3: Disable VPN**
- Turn off VPN on computer or iPhone
- VPNs can block local network connections

### "No usable data found" when scanning

**Problem:** You're using iPhone's camera app instead of Expo Go

**Solution:**
- Close Camera app
- Open **Expo Go** app
- Use the "Scan QR Code" button **inside Expo Go**

### "Network request failed"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Restart Expo with clear cache
npx expo start --clear
```

## üì≤ Testing iOS-Specific Features

Your app has iOS-specific features that will work with Expo Go:

### ‚úÖ Works with Expo Go:
- Face ID / Touch ID authentication
- Push notifications
- Camera and photo library
- Secure storage
- Haptic feedback
- Status bar styling

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Development Build:
- Custom native modules
- Some third-party libraries
- Advanced iOS features

For most development, **Expo Go is perfect!**

## üî® Building for iOS (Advanced)

If you eventually need to build a standalone iOS app:

### Option 1: EAS Build (Recommended - No Mac Required!)

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo account
eas login

# Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios --profile preview
```

**EAS Build runs in the cloud, so you don't need a Mac!**

The build takes 15-30 minutes and gives you:
- `.ipa` file for TestFlight
- Can be installed on your iPhone
- Ready for App Store submission

### Option 2: Local Build (Requires Mac + Xcode)

Only possible if you have a Mac:
```bash
npx expo run:ios
```

**Since you're on Windows, use EAS Build instead.**
