## üö´ Common Mistakes

Don't use your phone's built-in camera or QR scanner app!

Use the "Scan QR Code" button **inside the Expo Go app**.

## üìù Manual Connection (If QR Doesn't Work)

### Find Your Connection URL:

In your terminal, look for a line like:
```
‚Ä∫ Metro waiting on exp://192.168.1.100:8083
```

### In Expo Go App:
1. Tap "Enter URL manually" (usually at the bottom)
2. Type the URL exactly as shown (e.g., `exp://192.168.1.100:8083`)
3. Tap "Connect" or press Enter

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Could not connect to development server"

**Solution 1: Check WiFi**
- Computer and phone on same network?
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting WiFi on both

**Solution 2: Use Tunnel Mode**
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npx expo start --tunnel
```
This creates a public URL that works even on different networks.

**Solution 3: Check Firewall**
- Windows Firewall might be blocking port 8083
- Allow Node.js through firewall

### "No usable data found"

You're using your phone's camera app instead of Expo Go!
- Close camera app
- Open Expo Go app
- Use the "Scan QR Code" button inside Expo Go

- On corporate WiFi
- Using mobile data
