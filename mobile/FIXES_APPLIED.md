# Fixes Applied - Mobile App

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Network Request Failures
**Problem**: All API calls failing with "Network request failed"
**Root Cause**: API_URL was set to placeholder URL
**Solution**: 
- Added mock data system for development
- API client now detects when backend is unavailable
- Uses realistic mock data for all endpoints
- Simulates network delays for realistic testing

### 2. ‚úÖ Deprecated ImagePicker API
**Problem**: Warning about `ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions` being deprecated
**Solution**: Updated to use `ImagePicker.MediaType.Images`

### 3. ‚úÖ OrderDetail Component Navigation Error
**Problem**: "Got an invalid value for 'component' prop for screen 'OrderDetail'"
**Root Cause**: Complex component with potential circular imports
**Solution**: Created simplified OrderDetailScreen for now
**Status**: Temporary fix - can be reverted to full component when backend is ready

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è SecureStore Warning (Informational Only)
**Problem**: "Value being stored in SecureStore is larger than 2048 bytes"
**Status**: This is just a warning - app continues to work
**Impact**: None - Supabase tokens are large but still function properly
**Solution**: Added error handling to prevent crashes

## Mock Data System

The app now includes a comprehensive mock data system that provides:

### Mock Endpoints
- `GET /profile` - User profile data
- `GET /cart` - Shopping cart items
- `POST /cart` - Add item to cart
- `GET /orders` - Order history
- `GET /orders/:id` - Order details
- `GET /gallery` - Gallery items
- `POST /generate-upload-url` - Image upload URLs
- `POST /create-payment-intent` - Payment intents

### Mock Data Features
- Realistic sample data
- Proper TypeScript types
- Simulated network delays
- Console logging for debugging
- Automatic detection of mock mode

## Current App Status

### ‚úÖ Working Features
- Authentication (login/signup)
- Navigation between screens
- Image picker (camera/gallery)
- Mock image upload
- Cart display with mock data
- Order history with mock data
- Gallery with mock data
- Profile display
- All UI components and styling

### üîÑ Backend-Dependent Features (Using Mocks)
- Real API calls
- Actual image upload to S3
- Real payment processing
- Push notifications
- Data persistence

## Testing the App

### What You Can Test Now
1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Sign up with any email/password
   - Login with created account
   - Session persistence

2. **Navigation**
   - All tab navigation
   - Screen transitions
   - Back navigation

3. **Image Selection**
   - Camera capture
   - Gallery selection
   - Image preview

4. **UI Components**
   - All screens render correctly
   - Loading states
   - Error handling
   - Pull-to-refresh

5. **Mock Data Display**
   - Cart with sample items
   - Order history with sample orders
   - Gallery with sample images
   - Profile information

### How to Enable Real Backend
When your backend is ready:

1. Update `.env` file:
   ```env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-real-api-gateway-url.amazonaws.com/prod
   ```

2. The app will automatically detect the real URL and stop using mocks

3. Revert to full OrderDetailScreen:
   ```javascript
   // In App.js, change back to:
   import OrderDetailScreen from './src/screens/orders/OrderDetailScreen';
   ```

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start with clean cache
npm start -- --clear

# View logs
npx react-native log-ios
npx react-native log-android

# Check for issues
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test all screens** - Navigate through the entire app
2. **Verify mock data** - Check that all screens show realistic data
3. **Test image picker** - Try camera and gallery selection
4. **Check authentication** - Test login/logout flow
5. **Prepare backend** - When ready, update API_URL and test real endpoints
