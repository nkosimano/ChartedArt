## 🚨 CRITICAL GAP: Phase 2 Backend (0% COMPLETE)

**Your frontend is ready, but it needs the backend APIs!**

### What's Missing
All your frontend code currently relies on **mock data** in `src/lib/api/client.ts`. To make the app functional, you need:

#### Priority 1: Core Backend APIs (CRITICAL)
These are required for your existing frontend to work:

1. **Movements API** (5 endpoints)
   - `GET /movements` - List movements
   - `GET /movements/:id` - Movement details
   - `POST /movements/:id/join` - Join movement
   - `POST /movements/:id/donate` - Create payment intent
   - `POST /webhooks/stripe/movements` - Complete donation

2. **Puzzle Pieces API** (4 endpoints)
   - `GET /movements/:id/puzzle-pieces` - List pieces
   - `POST /puzzle-pieces/:id/reserve` - Reserve piece
   - `DELETE /puzzle-pieces/:id/reservation` - Cancel
   - `POST /puzzle-pieces/:id/purchase` - Complete purchase

3. **Events API** (7 endpoints)
   - `GET /events` - List events
   - `GET /events/:id` - Event details
   - `POST /events/:id/register` - Register
   - `POST /events/:id/upload-request` - Get upload URL
   - `POST /events/:id/submissions` - Confirm submission
   - `GET /events/:id/submissions` - List submissions
   - `POST /admin/submissions/:id/score` - Judge score

#### Priority 2: Background Jobs (HIGH)
4. **Cron Jobs** (2 functions)
   - Movement metrics aggregation (every 10 min)
   - Puzzle piece cleanup (every 5 min)

#### Priority 3: Remaining Features (MEDIUM)
5. **Blog API** (6 endpoints) - Not yet built in frontend
6. **Admin Dashboard APIs** - Not yet built in frontend

## 📋 What Still Needs to Be Built

### 🔴 Phase 2: Backend Lambda Functions (0% → 25%)
**Status**: Only utilities created, no handlers yet

**Completed**:
- ✅ `backend/src/utils/supabase.js` - Database wrapper
- ✅ `backend/src/utils/response.js` - HTTP responses

**Required** (16 Lambda functions):
- [ ] `movements-list.js`
- [ ] `movements-get.js`
- [ ] `movements-join.js`
- [ ] `movements-donate.js`
- [ ] `stripe-webhook-movements.js`
- [ ] `puzzle-pieces-list.js`
- [ ] `puzzle-pieces-reserve.js`
- [ ] `puzzle-pieces-cancel.js`
- [ ] `puzzle-pieces-purchase.js`
- [ ] `events-list.js`
- [ ] `events-get.js`
- [ ] `events-register.js`
- [ ] `events-upload-request.js`
- [ ] `events-submit.js`
- [ ] `events-submissions-list.js`
- [ ] `events-score.js`

Plus: 2 cron jobs + updated SAM template

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

### 🟡 Phase 3: Frontend - Blog UI (0% COMPLETE)
**What's Needed**:
- Blog listing page with search
- Category pages
- Post detail with SEO
- Comment system
- Admin editor

**Estimated Files**: 9 components, 4 pages  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

### 🟡 Phase 4: Admin Dashboard (0% COMPLETE)
**What's Needed**:
- Movement management
- Puzzle piece management
- Event management
- Blog editor
- Analytics dashboard
- User management

**Estimated Files**: 15 components, 8 pages  
**Estimated Effort**: 2 days

### 🟢 Phase 5: Testing (0% COMPLETE)
**What's Needed**:
- Unit tests for database functions
- Integration tests for API flows
- E2E tests for user journeys

**Estimated**: 50+ test files  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

### 🟢 Phase 6: Monitoring & Optimization (0% COMPLETE)
**What's Needed**:
- Datadog/Sentry setup
- Alert configuration
- Performance optimization
- Caching layer

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Complete Backend (Make Frontend Functional) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Goal**: Connect your beautiful frontend to real data

1. **Create Lambda handlers** (2 days)
   - Start with Movements API
   - Then Puzzle Pieces API
   - Finally Events API

2. **Update SAM template** (2 hours)
   - Add all Lambda function definitions
   - Configure EventBridge cron rules
   - Set up IAM roles

3. **Deploy and test** (4 hours)
   - Apply database migrations to Supabase
   - Deploy Lambda functions via SAM
   - Update frontend `.env` with real API URLs
   - Test end-to-end flows

**Timeline**: 2-3 days to fully functional app

### Option B: Complete All Frontend First
**Goal**: Finish Blog UI and Admin Dashboard

Would take 3-4 days but your app still wouldn't work without the backend.

### Option C: Full Testing Suite
Not recommended until backend is complete.

## 🚀 Quick Win: Deploy What You Have

Even without completing all backend APIs, you can:

1. **Deploy database migrations** (15 minutes)
   ```bash
   # In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
   supabase/migrations/20251016_001_movements_system.sql
   supabase/migrations/20251016_002_puzzle_pieces_system.sql
   supabase/migrations/20251016_003_events_competitions.sql
   supabase/migrations/20251016_004_blog_seo_system.sql
   ```

2. **Create one Lambda function** (30 minutes)
   - Start with `GET /movements`
   - Deploy to test the infrastructure
   - Verify frontend can connect

3. **Iterate from there**

## 💡 Key Insight

**You've done incredible work on the frontend!** But remember the architecture principle from WARP.md:

> "Loose Coupling: Systems must communicate through well-defined, versioned APIs."

Your frontend is calling APIs that don't exist yet. The **critical path** is:

```
Database ✅ → Backend APIs ❌ → Frontend ✅ → Testing ❌
```

You're in the middle with the backend blocking full functionality.

**Want me to help you build the backend Lambda functions now?** That's the fastest path to a fully functional app.

Just say: *"Build the backend APIs"* and I'll create all 16 Lambda handlers plus the updated SAM template.
