# 🚀 FINAL FIX - Commit Instructions

## 🔴 Critical Issue Found and Fixed

### Problem:
The AWS Amplify build failed with:
```
PluginError: Failed to resolve plugin for module "expo-notifications"
```

### Root Cause:
- `expo-notifications` was removed from `package.json` (as documented in START_HERE.md)
- BUT it was still listed in `mobile/app.json` plugins array
- Expo tried to load the plugin but couldn't find the package

### Solution Applied:
✅ Removed `expo-notifications` from `mobile/app.json` plugins array  
✅ Removed `UIBackgroundModes: ["remote-notification"]` from iOS config
