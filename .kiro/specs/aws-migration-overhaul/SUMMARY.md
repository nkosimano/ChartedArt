4. **Admin Operations Migration** - Secure backend endpoints for admin tasks
5. **Order Creation Migration** - Server-side order processing
6. **Payment Processing Migration** - Secure Stripe integration
7. **Design System** - Production color palette and styling
8. **Page Transitions** - Framer Motion animations
9. **Interactive Animations** - Button feedback and form states
10. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated deployment
11. **Environment Configuration** - Proper secrets management
12. **Incremental Migration** - Phased rollout strategy

### 🏗️ Design Document

**Architecture Transformation:**
- From: Client → Supabase (with exposed service key)
- To: Client → API Gateway → Lambda → Supabase (secure)

**Key Components:**
- AWS SAM Infrastructure as Code
- Lambda handlers for all business logic
- S3 for file storage with antivirus scanning
- API client layer for frontend
- Framer Motion animation system
- Comprehensive error handling
- Monitoring and observability

**New Color Palette:**
- **Sage** (hsl(120, 17%, 38%)) - Primary brand
- **Cream** (hsl(48, 100%, 97%)) - Background
- **Terracotta** (hsl(18, 53%, 54%)) - Accent
- **Lavender** (hsl(245, 35%, 74%)) - Support
- **Charcoal** (hsl(217, 19%, 27%)) - Text
- **Soft Green** (hsl(122, 39%, 49%)) - Success
- **Warming Red** (hsl(4, 64%, 52%)) - Error
- **Amber** (hsl(43, 90%, 55%)) - Warning
- **Soft Blue** (hsl(203, 47%, 74%)) - Info

**Custom Animations:**
- Gradient sweep (`.animate-gradient-x`)
- Ripple effect (`.animate-ripple`)
- Success pulse (`.animate-pulse-success`)
- Error shake (`.animate-shake-error`)
- Warning glow (`.animate-glow-warning`)

### ✅ Implementation Tasks (26 Major Tasks, 80+ Subtasks)

**Phase 3: UX/UI Overhaul (Tasks 15-17)**
- Design system updates (new color palette)
- Custom CSS animations
- Accessibility configuration
- Page transition animations
- Interactive component animations
- Gallery animations
- Accordion/FAQ animations

**Phase 4: Additional Features (Tasks 22-24)**
- Archive/unarchive orders
- Refund processing
- Gallery like/filter features
- Email notifications (AWS SES)

**Phase 5: Security & Compliance (Tasks 25-26)**
- Security validation
- WAF and rate limiting
- Database RLS
- Monitoring and alerting
- Automated backups
- Legal documentation
- Accessibility audit
- Production launch checklist

## Key Improvements from Original Plan

### Enhanced Design System
- Updated to production color palette (Sage, Cream, Terracotta, Lavender)
- Added 5 custom animation utilities
- Accessibility and motion preferences configuration

### Additional Backend Features
- Archive/unarchive order endpoints
- Refund payment processing
- Gallery like/filter functionality
- Email notifications with AWS SES

### Enhanced Security
- WAF configuration
- Rate limiting per user/IP
- Bot detection and CAPTCHA
- Database Row-Level Security (RLS)
- MFA/2FA for admin users

### Production Readiness
- Monitoring with CloudWatch, Sentry, LogRocket
- Automated backups with PITR
- Legal compliance (GDPR, PCI-DSS)
- Comprehensive accessibility audit
- Production launch checklist

## Task Execution Order

**Recommended Start:**
1. Task 1: Project Setup
2. Task 2: Security Vulnerability Elimination
3. Task 3: AWS SAM Template
4. Task 4-9: Backend Lambda Functions
5. Task 10-14: Frontend Migration
6. Task 15-17: UX/UI Overhaul
7. Task 18-21: Testing and Deployment
8. Task 22-24: Additional Features
9. Task 25-26: Security and Production Readiness

## Optional Tasks

The following task is marked as optional (with `*`):
- **Task 9.3**: Stripe webhook handler (good for production but not MVP-critical)

## Success Metrics

### Security
- ✅ No service keys in client bundle
- ✅ All admin operations require JWT + role validation
- ✅ File uploads through presigned URLs only
- ✅ Antivirus scanning on all uploads

### Functionality
