# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ChartedArt is currently a prototype application with critical security vulnerabilities and a client-heavy architecture using Supabase. This feature encompasses a complete architectural overhaul to migrate from the current Supabase-centric implementation to a secure, serverless AWS-native backend while implementing a production-ready emotion-driven design system with comprehensive animations. The migration prioritizes security by eliminating exposed service keys, establishes Infrastructure as Code practices using AWS SAM, and transforms the user experience through Framer Motion animations and a refined design system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Critical Security Remediation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all service-level credentials removed from the client-side code, so that the application's database and payment systems are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend code is built THEN the service role key SHALL NOT be included in any client-accessible bundle
2. WHEN admin operations are performed THEN they SHALL be executed through authenticated API endpoints rather than direct database access
3. IF a user inspects the browser's network traffic or source code THEN they SHALL NOT find any service-level API keys or secrets
4. WHEN the file `src/lib/supabase/admin-client.ts` is checked THEN it SHALL NOT exist in the codebase
5. WHEN environment variables are reviewed THEN all variables prefixed with `VITE_` SHALL contain only public keys suitable for client exposure

### Requirement 2: AWS Serverless Backend Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all backend services defined as Infrastructure as Code using AWS SAM, so that the infrastructure is reproducible, version-controlled, and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is deployed THEN it SHALL use AWS Lambda functions for all business logic
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL route through AWS API Gateway
3. WHEN infrastructure changes are needed THEN they SHALL be defined in a `backend/template.yaml` SAM template
4. IF the application needs to scale THEN the serverless architecture SHALL automatically handle increased load
5. WHEN Lambda functions execute THEN they SHALL access secrets through environment variables injected by SAM
6. WHEN the project structure is reviewed THEN there SHALL be a `backend/` directory containing `src/handlers/` and `template.yaml`

### Requirement 3: Secure File Storage Migration

**User Story:** As a user uploading artwork images, I want my files stored securely in AWS S3 with virus scanning, so that my content is protected and the platform remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a file THEN the frontend SHALL request a presigned S3 URL from a Lambda function
2. WHEN a presigned URL is generated THEN it SHALL have a limited expiration time
3. WHEN a file is uploaded to S3 THEN it SHALL trigger an antivirus scan Lambda function
4. IF a file contains malware THEN it SHALL be quarantined or deleted and the user SHALL be notified
5. WHEN files are stored THEN they SHALL use a unique bucket name incorporating the AWS account ID
6. WHEN CORS is configured THEN it SHALL allow uploads from the frontend domain

### Requirement 4: Admin Operations Backend Migration

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage orders through secure API endpoints, so that I can perform administrative tasks without exposing sensitive credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin views orders THEN the request SHALL be handled by a `/admin/orders` GET endpoint backed by Lambda
2. WHEN an admin updates order status THEN the request SHALL be handled by a secure Lambda function
3. WHEN admin endpoints are called THEN they SHALL verify the user's JWT token and admin role
4. IF a non-admin user attempts to access admin endpoints THEN they SHALL receive a 403 Forbidden response
5. WHEN admin operations query the database THEN they SHALL use the service key stored securely in Lambda environment variables

### Requirement 5: Order Creation Backend Migration

**User Story:** As a customer, I want my order creation to be processed securely on the backend, so that my purchase data is validated and stored reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes checkout THEN the order creation SHALL be handled by a `/orders` POST endpoint
2. WHEN the order creation Lambda executes THEN it SHALL validate cart contents before creating the order
3. WHEN an order is successfully created THEN the user's cart SHALL be cleared
4. IF order validation fails THEN the Lambda SHALL return a descriptive error message
5. WHEN order data is written THEN it SHALL use the secure Supabase service key in the Lambda environment

### Requirement 6: Payment Processing Backend Migration

**User Story:** As a customer making a payment, I want payment intents created securely on the backend, so that my payment information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates payment THEN the frontend SHALL call a `/create-payment-intent` POST endpoint
2. WHEN the payment intent Lambda executes THEN it SHALL use the Stripe secret key from environment variables
3. WHEN a payment intent is created THEN only the client secret SHALL be returned to the frontend
4. IF payment intent creation fails THEN the Lambda SHALL return an appropriate error response
5. WHEN Stripe webhooks are received THEN they SHALL be processed by a dedicated Lambda function

### Requirement 7: Design System Implementation

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want a cohesive and emotionally engaging visual design, so that my experience feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL use the color palette defined in the specification document
2. WHEN Tailwind CSS is configured THEN custom colors SHALL be defined in `tailwind.config.js`
3. WHEN custom animations are needed THEN they SHALL be defined as `@keyframes` in the global CSS
4. WHEN design tokens are referenced THEN they SHALL match the specification's color names and values
5. IF a component needs styling THEN it SHALL use the design system's predefined colors and spacing

### Requirement 8: Page Transition Animations

**User Story:** As a user navigating between pages, I want smooth animated transitions, so that the application feels fluid and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to a new page THEN the page SHALL fade in with a subtle upward motion
2. WHEN a user leaves a page THEN it SHALL fade out with a downward motion
3. WHEN page transitions occur THEN they SHALL complete within 500ms
4. IF multiple navigation events occur rapidly THEN AnimatePresence SHALL handle them gracefully
5. WHEN the route changes THEN the animation SHALL be keyed by the pathname to ensure proper triggering

### Requirement 9: Interactive Component Animations

**User Story:** As a user interacting with buttons and forms, I want visual feedback through animations, so that I understand my actions are being processed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over a primary action button THEN it SHALL scale to 105% of its original size
2. WHEN a user clicks a button THEN it SHALL scale down to 95% during the tap
3. WHEN a form is submitted THEN the submit button SHALL show a loading state with appropriate animation
4. IF a form submission fails THEN error inputs SHALL shake horizontally to draw attention
5. WHEN a form submission succeeds THEN success feedback SHALL be displayed with a fade-in animation
6. WHEN form state changes THEN the status SHALL be one of: 'idle', 'loading', 'success', or 'error'

### Requirement 10: CI/CD Pipeline with AWS CodePipeline

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated build and deployment processes, so that code changes are tested and deployed consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the repository THEN AWS CodePipeline SHALL automatically trigger a build

2. WHEN environment variables are added THEN they SHALL be categorized by service (Supabase, Stripe, AWS, etc.)
3. WHEN the frontend needs configuration THEN public variables SHALL use the `VITE_` prefix
4. WHEN the backend needs configuration THEN secrets SHALL be passed through SAM parameters
5. IF a required environment variable is missing THEN the application SHALL fail with a clear error message

### Requirement 12: Incremental Migration Strategy

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want the migration to occur in phases, so that we can test each component and minimize disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria
