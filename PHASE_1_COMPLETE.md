- ✅ Automatic search vector updates via trigger
- ✅ SEO-friendly URL structure (permanent categories)
- ✅ Autocomplete suggestions
- ✅ Read time calculation
- ✅ Engagement tracking (likes, comments, views)

**Search Functions**:
- `search_blog_posts()` - Full-text search with ranking
- `blog_search_suggestions()` - Autocomplete for UI
- `increment_blog_post_views()` - View counter

**Pre-populated Categories**:
1. Artist Spotlights
2. Behind the Scenes
3. Art Techniques
4. Community Stories
5. Social Impact
6. News & Updates

## How to Apply Migrations

### Using Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run migrations in order:
   ```
   1. 20251016_001_movements_system.sql
   2. 20251016_002_puzzle_pieces_system.sql
   3. 20251016_003_events_competitions.sql
   4. 20251016_004_blog_seo_system.sql
   ```
3. Verify each migration completes successfully before proceeding

### Using Supabase CLI
```bash
# From project root
supabase db push
```

### Manual Verification Queries
```sql
-- Check all tables created
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN (
  'movements', 'movement_metrics', 'puzzle_pieces', 
  'competition_submissions', 'blog_categories'
)
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Verify triggers
SELECT trigger_name, event_object_table 
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY event_object_table, trigger_name;

-- Verify functions
SELECT routine_name, routine_type 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
AND routine_name LIKE '%movement%' OR routine_name LIKE '%puzzle%'
ORDER BY routine_name;

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT tablename, policyname 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

## Architecture Compliance

### ✅ Core Principles Met
- **Optional Integration**: All features use feature flags and graceful degradation
- **Loose Coupling**: Well-defined APIs, no direct cross-schema queries
- **Performance First**: Indexed properly, triggers for instant updates
- **Privacy Aware**: RLS policies, explicit consent checks
- **Graceful Degradation**: Soft deletes, archived_at timestamps

### ✅ Technical Guardrails
- **Database Migrations Only**: All changes via versioned SQL files
- **Atomic Operations**: Row-level locks prevent race conditions
- **Webhook-Driven**: Donation/payment completion only via webhooks
- **Background Jobs**: Cleanup functions ready for cron schedules

## Next Steps: Phase 2

### Backend Lambda Functions
1. **Movements API**
   - GET `/movements` - List active movements
   - POST `/movements` - Create movement (admin)
   - GET `/movements/:id` - Movement details
   - POST `/movements/:id/join` - Join movement
   - POST `/movements/:id/donate` - Initiate donation
   - POST `/webhooks/stripe` - Complete donation

2. **Puzzle Pieces API**
   - GET `/movements/:id/puzzle-pieces` - List pieces
   - POST `/puzzle-pieces/:id/reserve` - Reserve piece
   - DELETE `/puzzle-pieces/:id/reservation` - Cancel
   - POST `/puzzle-pieces/:id/purchase` - Complete purchase

3. **Events API**
   - GET `/events` - List events
   - POST `/events/:id/register` - Register
   - POST `/events/:id/submit` - Create submission
   - GET `/events/:id/submissions` - List (with blind judging)
   - POST `/admin/submissions/:id/score` - Judge score

4. **Blog API**
   - GET `/blog/posts` - List with filters
   - GET `/blog/search` - Full-text search
   - GET `/blog/suggestions` - Autocomplete
   - GET `/blog/:slug` - Post detail

5. **Background Jobs**
   - Movement metric aggregation (10-min cron)
   - Puzzle piece cleanup (5-min cron)

## Performance Targets
- P95 latency < 500ms for all endpoints
- Database query time < 100ms
- Full-text search response < 200ms

## Monitoring Requirements
- Track all database function execution times
- Alert on failed Stripe webhooks
- Monitor puzzle piece reservation race conditions
- Track blog search performance
