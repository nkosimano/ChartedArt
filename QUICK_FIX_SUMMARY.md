# Quick Fix Summary

## Issues and Resolutions

### ✅ FIXED: Import Path Error
**Error:** `Failed to resolve import "../lib/supabase" from "src/utils/imageUpload.ts"`

**Fix Applied:** Updated the import in `imageUpload.ts` to use the correct path:
```typescript
import { supabase } from '../lib/supabase/client';
```

This is already fixed in the code. Just reload your dev server.
